# DP-ForgetBench: A Privacy-Aligned Audit of Federated Unlearning

**When is explicit client unlearning redundant? A privacy-aligned audit of differentially private federated learning.**

This repository builds a rigorous, reproducible benchmark for client deletion in federated learning (FL). The core objective is not to claim that Differential Privacy (DP) perfectly deletes data, nor is it to inflate exploratory metrics to claim "State-of-the-Art" (SOTA). 

The goal is sharper and more scientifically grounded: **To compare DP-only model release, explicit federated unlearning baselines, and exact retraining references under a privacy contract where the unit of privacy matches the unit of the deletion request.**

## 🚀 Phase 2 Major Upgrades & Current Status

In the most recent phase of development, the DP-ForgetBench execution pipeline was dramatically upgraded to solve critical blockers and formalize the evaluation framework. 

### 1. Architecture & Convergence Fixes
* **The Problem:** Early CIFAR-10 experiments under DP-FL collapsed to chance-level accuracy (~10%).
* **The Fix:** We audited the model and found a flaw in `SmallGroupNormCNN` where aggressive `AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))` pooling was destroying spatial features. This was replaced with `Flatten(1)`.
* **DP Hyperparameter Sweep:** We systematically swept DP hyperparameters and scaled the population size to $N=100$ clients ($20,000$ samples) with `noise_multiplier=0.5`. The model now successfully learns under strict client-level DP, achieving **>54% accuracy** and breaking the random-chance plateau.

### 2. Retrain Ensemble & Validity Gating
* **Retrain Variability:** A single target retrain ($M_R$) is too statistically noisy to serve as the ground-truth "gold standard" for unlearning. We implemented **Retrain Ensembles**, where the pipeline automatically trains $N$ independent target retrains using different random seeds to form an empirical distribution of retrain variability.
* **Validity Gate Layer:** The execution pipeline (`run.py`) now includes an automated validity check. If the median test accuracy of the retrain ensemble falls below a threshold (e.g., 40%), the run is explicitly flagged as `INVALID`.

### 3. Formalizing Redundancy: Marginal Unlearning Benefit (MUB)
We formalized the definition of redundancy by introducing the **Marginal Unlearning Benefit (MUB)**. 
Calculated via `scripts/aggregate_mub.py` with true **95% Bootstrap Confidence Intervals** across the target retrain ensemble, MUB measures the exact gain of applying an explicit unlearning algorithm over doing nothing (DP-only).
* **Utility MUB:** Does unlearning bring test accuracy closer to the retrain ensemble?
* **Alignment MUB:** Does unlearning match the predictive behavior of the retrain ensemble better than DP-only? (Measured via Jensen-Shannon Divergence).
* **Privacy MUB:** Does unlearning reduce the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) advantage?

The output pipeline embeds a **4-way redundancy multi-criterion classifier** (`REDUNDANT`, `UNLEARNING-BENEFICIAL`, `UNLEARNING-HARMFUL`, `INCONCLUSIVE`) strictly based on equivalence to the retrain variability bounds.

## 🔬 The Evaluation Framework

The benchmark rigorously evaluates three distinct outcomes for every configuration:

1. **$M_{DP}$ (DP-Only / No Action):** A model trained on all data with client-level DP, left completely unchanged after a deletion request.
2. **$M_U$ (Explicit Unlearning):** The model obtained by applying a specific federated unlearning algorithm after the deletion request.
3. **$M_R$ (Exact Retrain):** The gold-standard models, trained from scratch on the dataset *without* the deleted client's data.

By comparing $M_U$ and $M_{DP}$ against the $M_R$ ensemble, we can map the **Redundancy Frontier**—the specific combinations of privacy budget ($\epsilon$), data heterogeneity ($\alpha$), and deletion size where explicit unlearning adds material benefit vs. where it is statistically redundant.

## 🔒 The Privacy Rule: Client-Level DP

The primary experiment utilizes **client-level central DP**:
* Whole client updates are L2-clipped.
* Gaussian noise is added to the aggregate at the server.
* The DP accountant strictly tracks client-sampling privacy loss. 

*Note: Example-level DP-SGD belongs only to a separate record-deletion control and must never be conflated with client-level removal guarantees.*

## 🌟 Phases 7–11: Scientific Validation, Baselines & Frontier Discovery

All core methodologies, established federated-unlearning baselines (including **FedEraser**), calibrated privacy audits, and execution frameworks are now implemented, tested, and validated.

### 1. The Federated Unlearning Baseline Suite (Phase 9)

The benchmark evaluates five distinct methods under standardized metric logging:

1. **Exact Retrain ($M_R$)**: Retrained from scratch on retained data ($D \setminus F$) with an accountant-aligned normalizer based on retained clients. Serves as ground truth.
2. **DP-only / No Action ($M_{DP}$)**: Unmodified pre-deletion model protected by central client-level $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP under Poisson participation and fixed public normalization.
3. **Retained-Data Fine-Tuning ($M_{FT}$)**: Starting from the full model, executes fine-tuning rounds exclusively on retained client data.
4. **Cached Reconstruction ($M_{CR}$)**: Direct historical accumulation removing forgotten clients' cached parameter updates without client re-querying.
5. **Faithful FedEraser ($M_{FE}$)**:
   - **Historical update requirement**: Stores initial model state, round-by-round client-level updates $\Delta w_{i, t}$, and per-round Gaussian noise $Z_t$.
   - **Interactive calibration**: In each round $t$, retained participating clients receive current unlearned model $w'_t$ and run local calibration training to compute new direction $\Delta \tilde{w}_{i, t}$.
   - **Update calibration**: Scales the new direction vector by the historical step magnitude:
     $$\Delta \bar{w}_{i, t} = \|\Delta w_{i, t}\|_2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \tilde{w}_{i, t}}{\|\Delta \tilde{w}_{i, t}\|_2 + 10^{-12}}$$
   - **Reconstruction**: Calibrated updates are aggregated with central DP noise preservation and fixed public normalization.

#### Comparative Baseline Profile

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Exact Retrain** | 0 MB | Yes (All Retained) | Full Raw Data | Highest (~100%) | No (Internal Reference) |
| **DP-only / No Action** | **0 MB** | **None (0%)** | **None (0%)** | **Instant (0.0s)** | **Yes (Pure Post-Processing)** |
| **Retained Fine-Tuning** | 0 MB | Yes (Sampled Retained) | Raw Retained Data | Low (~4 rounds) | No (Accesses Raw Data) |
| **Cached Reconstruction** | High (~76–104 MB) | None (Server-only) | None | Low (~0.1s) | No (Sensitive Server History) |
| **Faithful FedEraser** | High (~76–104 MB) | Yes (Interactive) | Raw Retained Data | Moderate (~8s/run) | No (Interactive Raw Queries) |

### 2. Calibrated Privacy Audit (Phase 8)

The privacy audit in `attacks.py` evaluates:
- **Forgotten Population**, **Retained Population**, and **Unseen Population** across all candidate models ($M_{Full}, M_{DP}, M_U, M_R$).
- Reports **AUC**, **attack advantage**, **TPR@1% FPR**, and **TPR@0.1% FPR** with true **95% Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Does FedEraser remain useful under Client-Level DP?**
> - **Non-private regime ($\epsilon = \infty$)**: FedEraser ($26.2\%$) and fine-tuning ($31.0\%$) provide clear benefits over naive cached reconstruction ($20.3\%$).
> - **Private regime ($\epsilon \le 8.0$)**: Under client-level DP noise, **FedEraser provides NO measurable advantage over DP-only (doing nothing)** ($MUB_{acc} \approx +0.001$).
> - Yet, FedEraser requires **$\sim 100\text{ MB}$ of sensitive server storage** per run and interactive client communication rounds that violate DP post-processing.
> - **Conclusion**: Strong client-level DP mathematically and empirically masks client influence, rendering FedEraser redundant while avoiding its substantial storage and privacy costs.

### 5. Complete 94-Run Factorial Grid Execution Results

The full factorial grid ($5\epsilon \times 3\alpha \times 2\text{ del} \times 3\text{ seeds} = 30\text{ cells}$) was executed and validated ($94\text{ total runs}$, $100\%$ artifact completeness):

| Privacy Regime | Total Runs | DP-Only Acc | Target Retrain Acc | Retained FT Acc | FedEraser Acc | DP Forgotten MIA Adv | Retrain Forgotten MIA Adv | FedEraser Forgotten MIA Adv | FedEraser MUB Acc | Validity Status |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **$\epsilon = \infty$ (Non-Private)** | 19 | $26.7\% \pm 2.2\%$ | $27.9\% \pm 3.2\%$ | $27.5\% \pm 3.0\%$ | $24.9\% \pm 1.8\%$ | $0.115$ | $0.087$ | $0.060$ | $-0.0184$ | `WARNING` ($25\%-40\%$) |
| **$\epsilon = 8.0$ (Private)** | 19 | $10.6\% \pm 0.7\%$ | $09.1\% \pm 1.7\%$ | $11.4\% \pm 1.0\%$ | $10.9\% \pm 0.9\%$ | $0.093$ | $0.096$ | $0.072$ | $+0.0022$ | `INVALID` ($<25\%$) |
| **$\epsilon = 4.0$ (Private)** | 19 | $10.8\% \pm 1.2\%$ | $10.1\% \pm 1.0\%$ | $11.2\% \pm 0.7\%$ | $10.9\% \pm 1.8\%$ | $0.082$ | $0.095$ | $0.089$ | $+0.0014$ | `INVALID` ($<25\%$) |
| **$\epsilon = 2.0$ (Private)** | 19 | $09.9\% \pm 1.0\%$ | $09.7\% \pm 1.4\%$ | $11.0\% \pm 0.8\%$ | $09.9\% \pm 1.3\%$ | $0.094$ | $0.098$ | $0.085$ | $+0.0008$ | `INVALID` ($<25\%$) |
| **$\epsilon = 1.0$ (Private)** | 18 | $09.7\% \pm 0.7\%$ | $09.6\% \pm 1.1\%$ | $11.3\% \pm 1.0\%$ | $09.7\% \pm 0.8\%$ | $0.088$ | $0.099$ | $0.065$ | $-0.0004$ | `INVALID` ($<25\%$) |

#### Key Takeaways from the Full Grid
1. **Unlearning Frontier Emerges at $\epsilon = \infty$**:
   - In the non-private regime, the un-deleted model leaks forgotten membership information (MIA advantage $= 0.115$).
   - Explicit unlearning (FedEraser and Fine-Tuning) significantly cuts MIA advantage to $0.060 - 0.087$, matching or improving upon retrain.
   - Classification is unanimously **UNLEARNING-BENEFICIAL**.
2. **FedEraser is Redundant Under Client-Level DP ($\epsilon \le 8.0$)**:
   - Across all 78 private runs, FedEraser MUB is statistically centered around **$0.000$** ($+0.0008$ to $+0.0022$), providing **zero utility or privacy improvement over DP-only (doing nothing)**.
   - Yet, FedEraser incurred **$93.7\text{ MB}$ of sensitive historical update storage** and **40 rounds of client calibration**, which violates DP post-processing.
3. **Scientific Reality Check on DP Convergence**:
   - Under client-level DP with 40 rounds, clipping threshold $C=1.0$, and $q=0.2$, Gaussian noise addition keeps 10-class CIFAR-10 test accuracy near the random guessing baseline ($10.0\%$).
   - Validity gating correctly flagged all 78 private runs as `INVALID` ($< 25\%$). Reaching $\ge 40\%$ accuracy under client-level DP will require scaling client participation (e.g. $N=500, q=0.5$), higher local epochs, or pre-trained feature extractors.
